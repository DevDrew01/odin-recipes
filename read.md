This is the first project of The Odin Project.

I created a Food Recipe website.

I learned to use the basics of the elements in the HTML.

I used the heading to highlight the title.

I used the paragraph element for the description.

I used the Unordered list to list ingredients.

I used the Ordered list for the steps.

I used the img element for the images and used the attributes src, alt, height, and width accordingly.

I also used the a (anchor) element that link the homepage to the food recipes listed, vice versa.
